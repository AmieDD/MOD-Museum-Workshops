Feeling adventurous and creative? Amie DD is looking for people to help make the backpiece and breastplate parts of her cosplay costume sparkle with LED gems. In this workshop you will have fun learning how to work with resin, including mixing in dye to change your gem colour, casting the resin and how to set LEDs to make your bright, colourful electronic gems. See your creative work in front of hundreds of people at Hybrid World Adelaide the following day and exhibited at MOD. after. Plus you will get to keep your own resin cast LED gems to inspire your next design using your newly acquired skills that will bring a little spark into your life.

This workshop is delivered in partnership with MOD., Australia's leading future-focused museum, provoking new ideas at the intersection of science, art, and innovation.

(Please note that rubber latex gloves are used in this workshop, so this workshop would not be suitable for anyone with a latex allergy)
