# Workshop #3 - Making Space Junk Props
![AmieDD Workshop 3 Space Junk Props](https://github.com/AmieDD/MOD-Museum-Workshops/blob/master/Images/Workshop3.png)

In this workshop you will channel your inner Wall-E to help build space junk belt props. Think toy rockets, antennas, extra life glowing jars, laser cut foam pieces and other fun and (hopefully) messy things. Your creativity will be rewarded with each workshop participant being able to keep their own space junk part you make, using LEDs, foam, thermoplastic modelling material Worbla and 3D printed parts. Don't miss this fun workshop.

This workshop is delivered in partnership with MOD., Australia's leading future-focused museum, provoking new ideas at the intersection of science, art, and innovation.

This workshop is supported by Flexo, the world's only flexible brick system.
