Workshop #1 - Learn To Solder Things!

Heat up your school holidays with an intro to soldering workshop. This is no ordinary "how-to" workshop! This one is themed Space Junk with Amie DD as your creative electronics leader who will walk you through the basics of soldering and assist you to make your own electronic badge.

Once you have mastered this you will get the chance to rummage through metal pieces to create your very own soldered metal piece for Amie's cosplay Space Junk Belt. Contribute your newly acquired skills to work on the 'Power-Up' giveaways for Hybrid World Adelaide activation too (yes! Your work will be seen and used by hundreds of people).

You will have the opportunity to take home your solder badge of honour and your very own 3D Powerup item to brag to all your friends about your new awesome soldering skills.

This workshop is delivered in partnership with MOD., Australia's leading future-focused museum, provoking new ideas at the intersection of science, art, and innovation.

This workshop is supported by Flexo, the world's only flexible brick system.
