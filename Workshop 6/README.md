# Workshop #6 - Props, Swords, and Magic!

![Workshop 6 Hybrid World AmieDD](https://github.com/AmieDD/MOD-Museum-Workshops/blob/master/Images/Workshop6.png)

Props, swords and magic, oh my! Amie's space junk quest requires a powerful, plasma orb sword to complete her cosplay outfit. You are invited to help her on her quest by assisting on the build of her prop sword using LEDs and skirt LED NeoPixels!

This workshop will use soldering irons, so if you are feeling like you need to refresh your soldering skills, you might like to attend Workshop #1.

Your assistance on this quest will end with powering up the orb and taking home your own mini foam sword (similar to the final prop sword) as a memento of your journey. Your work will be exhibited at Hybrid World Adelaide and MOD.

This workshop is delivered in partnership with MOD., Australia's leading future-focused museum, provoking new ideas at the intersection of science, art, and innovation.

This workshop is supported by Flexo, the world's only flexible brick system.
